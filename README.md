WordPress content source implementation.

## Overview

The BbAppContentSourceWordPress library provides a concrete implementation of the content source protocol for WordPress-powered backends. This module enables communication with WordPress REST APIs, transforms WordPress data into the application's content schema, and handles WordPress-specific authentication and content operations. It extends the base WordPress functionality to support WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress installations.
